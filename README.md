# Don-tBeFake

Don’tBeFake is a photo sharing app based on BeReal to share once a day your real life in photo with friends… But with a twist.

Don’tBeFake implements a NotFake Points counter which will increase the more you post on time, and decrease when you don’t post or post late.

Every day at a different time, everyone captures a photo within 2 minutes.

Capture and post in time to increase your NotFake Points and be the Realest in your friends.
